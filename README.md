# A-Hybrid-Framework-for-Intrusion-Detection-in-Healthcare-Systems-Using-Deep-Learning
💡 Overview:
This project implements a hybrid intrusion detection framework for healthcare systems, utilizing deep learning to analyze and classify network packets. The system continuously monitors packets transmitted through the router in an internet connection, detecting whether a packet is normal or part of a cyber attack.

🚀 Key Features:
✅ Real-Time Packet Analysis: Monitors network traffic to identify suspicious activity.
✅ Intrusion Classification: Detects whether a packet is normal or part of an attack.
✅ Attack Type Identification: Classifies different types of attacks (e.g., DNS attack, DDoS, SQL injection, etc.).
✅ Deep Learning Model: Uses CNNs, RNNs, or hybrid architectures for high accuracy.
✅ Healthcare Security: Enhances security in healthcare systems, protecting sensitive patient data from cyber threats.

🔬 Technology Stack:

Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
Network Traffic Analysis
Packet Classification
Cybersecurity Techniques
🌍 Impact:
This framework helps secure healthcare networks against cyber threats, ensuring patient data privacy and system integrity. It strengthens real-time threat detection, reducing the risk of cyberattacks in sensitive environments.
